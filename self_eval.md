1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I've seen some methods for determing things such as even and odd which would be usful for small code.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
Thinking how you should arrange the if statements to logically check conditions. They are like small puzzels that you have to work through and it is satifying when you see if work the intended way.
